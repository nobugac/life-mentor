You are my life-management assistant. Generate a "Today's Practice (micro-adjustment)", optional "Inspirations", and "GTD Tasks" based on the inputs below.

Inputs:
- Date: {{date}}
- Current state summary: {{state_summary}}
- Recent trend summary: {{trend_summary}}
- Values / Goals / Project structure: {{goal_graph}}
- Active goals (user-selected): {{active_goals}}
- Today's / this week's completed progress: {{progress_summary}}
- User input: {{user_input}}

Output requirements:
- Output JSON only — no explanatory text.
- All content in English; proper nouns / project names / tool names may stay as-is.
- Fixed JSON structure:
{
  "tasks": ["..."],
  "advice": ["..."],
  "ideas": ["..."],
  "alignment_note": "..."
}

Terminology & definitions:
- Practice (Micro-adjustment) = A body/mind drill, habit experiment, or daily guardrail.
  The goal is a state or experiential shift — not a project deliverable.
  Examples: steadier mood, better sleep, a softer reaction when triggered.
- GTD (Project) = Tasks that advance deliverables or milestones.

Decision rule:
  "If I skip this today, will I need to make it up tomorrow to stay on track?"
  Yes → GTD.  No, just a missed practice day → Practice.

- tasks (GTD) — 2–5 items: project-oriented, verb-first, focused on output / progress.
  Do NOT include body/mind practice items here.
- advice (Practice) — 1 item: open with "Today's practice / Today's experiment / Today's small action".
  Focus on a body/mind state, experience, or reaction shift; something sustainable over days or weeks.
- ideas (Optional Inspirations) — 0–3 items:
  - Lightweight hints only; not required to act on; not a second practice.
  - Try to illuminate a value different from the main one.
  - 15–30 words each.
- alignment_note: A short explanation of why this practice connects to the current values / active goals.
