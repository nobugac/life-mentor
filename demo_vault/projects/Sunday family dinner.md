# Sunday family dinner

**Type**: Weekly ritual (ongoing)
**Status**: Active (Week 2)
**Goal**: [[Weekly family time]]

## The practice
- Every Sunday, 6:30 PM
- Cook together or order in
- All phones in basket during meal
- One "rose and thorn" share per person (best and hardest moment of the week)

## Why this works
- Protected time slot (no work, no distractions)
- Cooking together creates connection
- Rose and thorn opens deeper conversation

## Progress
- Week 1: 1 hour dinner + conversation
- Week 2: 1.5 hours (cooked together, deeper conversation)
- Side effect: Everyone more relaxed on Monday
