# Daily reading 20min

**Type**: Behavior experiment (7-day cycles)
**Status**: Active (Week 2)
**Goal**: [[Read 20 books in 2026]]

## The practice
- After 9 PM: replace phone scroll with 20 minutes of reading
- Physical book (not Kindle or iPad)
- Track pages read in daily note

## Why this works
- Replaces evening screen time with deeper activity
- Supports sleep quality (no blue light)
- Compounds into ~2 books/month

## Progress
- Week 1: 4/7 days (50 pages total)
- Week 2: 6/7 days (85 pages total)
- Currently reading: "Atomic Habits"
