# Morning walk 15min

**Type**: Behavior experiment (7-day cycles)
**Status**: Active (Week 2)
**Goal**: [[Daily movement 30min]]

## The practice
- Right after morning coffee, before checking work messages
- 15-minute walk around the block
- No phone or podcasts — just walking and noticing

## Why this works
- Anchored to existing habit (coffee)
- Low barrier (just 15 min)
- Energy boost for the day
- Reduces morning phone scroll

## Progress
- Week 1: 2/7 days (forgot on busy mornings)
- Week 2: 5/7 days (much better consistency)
- Side effect: Less morning screen time
