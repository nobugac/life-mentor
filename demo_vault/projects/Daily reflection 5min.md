# Daily reflection 5min

**Type**: Behavior experiment (7-day cycles)
**Status**: Active (Week 2)
**Goal**: [[Learn AI development basics]]

## The practice
- End of work day: 5-minute reflection in daily note
- What did I learn today? What's unclear?
- One small insight or question to explore

## Why this works
- Solidifies learning through active recall
- Identifies gaps and next steps
- Creates learning log for future reference

## Progress
- Week 1: 3/7 days (often forgot)
- Week 2: 5/7 days (better with reminder)
- Key insight this week: Prompt structure matters more than model choice
