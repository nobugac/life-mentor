# Family

Core principle: Consistent presence and intentional connection with family, even when physically apart.

## Why this matters
Relationships require time and attention. In the rush of work and daily life, family time is often the first thing to get squeezed. Intentional rituals protect this.

## How I measure it
- Weekly family time: Quality hours together (not just cohabitation)
- Monthly check-ins: Video calls with parents
- Presence: Phone away during meals and conversations

## Key practices
- Sunday family dinner (no phones at table)
- Monthly 30-min video call with parents
- Weekly shared activity (walk, game, cooking)
