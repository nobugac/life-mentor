# My Values

Core principles that guide decisions and priorities.

## Active Values

1. **[[Health]]** — Sustainable energy and recovery
2. **[[Inner Growth]]** — Continuous learning and self-awareness
3. **[[Family]]** — Intentional connection and presence

## How I use this

Values are the "why" behind goals and actions. When choosing what to work on or what to say no to, I check: does this align with my values?

LifeMentor uses these values to:
- Prioritize daily suggestions (main value gets primary focus)
- Group metrics and trends by value
- Suggest experiments that align with what I care about
