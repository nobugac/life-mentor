# Inner Growth

Core principle: Continuous learning, reflection, and self-awareness through deliberate practice and mindful attention.

## Why this matters
Personal growth compounds over time. Small daily practices — reading, reflection, skill-building — create the foundation for long-term development and adaptability.

## How I measure it
- Learning: Books read, courses completed, new skills practiced
- Reflection: Daily journaling, weekly reviews
- Mindfulness: Quality of attention, reduced reactivity

## Key practices
- Morning reflection before checking phone
- Weekly review of progress and patterns
- Deliberate practice on focused skills
