# Health

Core principle: Sustainable energy and recovery through consistent sleep, movement, and stress management.

## Why this matters
Physical health is the foundation for everything else — work, relationships, growth. When sleep is poor or stress is high, everything else suffers.

## How I measure it
- Sleep: 7.5+ hours per night, HRV trend
- Movement: Consistent light activity (walking, stretching)
- Stress recovery: Screen time under 90 mins/day, no phone after 10 PM
